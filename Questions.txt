### Primitives(87) ###
5.1 Computing the parity of a word.
    How would you compute the parity of a very large number of 64-bit words?
5.2 Swap Bits
5.3 Reverse Bits
    Write a program that takes a 64-bit word and returns the 64-bit word consisting 
    of the bits of the input word in reverse order.
5.4 Find the closest Integer with the same weight
    Write a program which takes as input a non negative integer x and returns a number 
    y which is not equal to x, but has the same weight as x and their difference ,[y-x]
    is as small as possible.Ex. if x = 6, return 5.
5.5 Compute x * y without arithmatic operators
    Write a program that multiplies two nonnegative integers.The only operators you are allowed
    to user are i)assignments,ii)the bitwise operators >>,<<,|,&,~,^ and iii)equality checks and 
    Boolean combinations thereof.
5.6 Compute x/y
    Given two possible integers, compute their quotients, using only the addition,substraction, 
    and shifting operators.
5.7 Compute x^y
    Write a program that takes a double x and an integer y and returns x^y.You can ignore overflow 
    and underflow.
5.8 Reverse Digits
    Write a program which takes an integer and returns the integer corresponding to the digits of 
    the input written in reverse order.Ex ; 42 -> 24 & -314 -> -413
5.9 Check if a decimal integer is a palindrome
    Write a program that takes an integer and determines if that integer's representation as a decimal 
    string is a palindrome.
5.10 Generate Uniform Random Numbers
    How would you implement a random number generator that generates a random integer i between a and b,inclusive,
    given a random number generators that produces zero or one with equal probability? All values in [a,b]
    should be equally likely.
5.11 Rectangle Intersection
    Write a program which tests if two rectangles have a nonempty intersection.If the intersection is nonempty,
    return the rectangle formed by their intersection.

12.1 Search a sorted array for first occurance of 'K'
    Write a method that takes a sorted array and a key and returns the index of the first occurance of that key in the array.
    Ex , array : (-14,-10,2,108,108,243,285,285,285,401) :: key : 108 :: result : 3
12.2 Search a sorted array for entry equals to its index
    Design an efficient algorithm that takes a sorted array of distinct integers, and returns an index i such that the element at index i equals i.
    input : (-2,0,2,3,6,7,9) :: result : 2 or 3
12.3 Search a cyclical sorted array
    Design an O(log n) algorithm for finding the position of the smallest element in a cyclical sorted array.
    Assume all elements are distinct.
    input : (378,478,550,631,103,203,220,234,279,368) :: result : 4
12.4 Compute the integer square root
    Write a program which takes a nonnegative integer and returns the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given integer.
    input : 16 :: result : 4 :: input : 300 :: result : 17 as 17^2 = 289 < 300 and 18^2 > 300
12.5 Compute the real square root
    Implements a function which takes as input a floating point value and returns its square root.
12.6 Search in a 2D sorted array
    Design an algorithm that takes a 2D sorted array and a number and checks whether that number appears in the array.
    input : {{-1,2,4,4,6},{1,5,5,9,21},{3,6,6,9,22},{3,6,8,10,24},{6,8,9,12,25},{8,10,12,13,40}} :: number : 7 :: result : false 
12.7 Find the Min and Max simultaneously
    Design an algorithm to find the min and max elements in an array.
    input : A = (3,2,5,1,2,4) :: min : 1 & max : 5
12.8 Find the Kth largest element 
    Design an algorithm for computing the kth largest element in an array.Assume entries are distinct.
    input: A(3,2,1,5,4) :: result : 1st : A(3)
12.9 Find the missing IP address
    Suppose you were given a file containing roughly one billion IP address, each of which a 32 bit quantity.How would you programmatically 
    find an IP address that is not in the file?Assume you have unlimited drive space but only few  megabytes of RAM at your disposal.
12.10 Find the duplicate and missing elements
    You are given an array of n integers,each between 0 and n-1,inclusive. Exactly one element appears twice, implying that exactly one number between 0 and n-1
    is missing from the array.
