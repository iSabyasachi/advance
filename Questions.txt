### Primitives(87) ###
5.1 Computing the parity of a word.
    How would you compute the parity of a very large number of 64-bit words?
5.2 Swap Bits
5.3 Reverse Bits
    Write a program that takes a 64-bit word and returns the 64-bit word consisting 
    of the bits of the input word in reverse order.
5.4 Find the closest Integer with the same weight
    Write a program which takes as input a non negative integer x and returns a number 
    y which is not equal to x, but has the same weight as x and their difference ,[y-x]
    is as small as possible.Ex. if x = 6, return 5.
5.5 Compute x * y without arithmatic operators
    Write a program that multiplies two nonnegative integers.The only operators you are allowed
    to user are i)assignments,ii)the bitwise operators >>,<<,|,&,~,^ and iii)equality checks and 
    Boolean combinations thereof.
5.6 Compute x/you
    Given two possible integers, compute their quotients, using only the addition,substraction, 
    and shifting operators.
5.7 Compute x^y
    Write a program that takes a double x and an integer y and returns x^y.You can ignore overflow 
    and underflow.
5.8 Reverse Digits
    Write a program which takes an integer and returns the integer corresponding to the digits of 
    the input written in reverse order.Ex ; 42 -> 24 & -314 -> -413
5.9 Check is a decimal integer is a palindrome
    Write a program that takes an integer and determines if that integer's representation as a decimal 
    string is a palindrome.
5.10 Generate Uniform Random Numbers
    How would you implement a random number generator that generates a random integer i between a and b,inclusive,
    given a random number generators that produces zero or one with equal probability? All values in [a,b]
    should be equally likely.
5.11 Rectangle Intersection
    Write a program which tests if two rectangles have a nonempty intersection.If the intersection is nonempty,
    return the rectangle formed by their intersection.
